# Python baseline fixtures

- `video_data/DevOops_conf/-kq832Othh4.json` and `video_data/HighLoadChannel/-3BfHrrnJR0.json` are canonical outputs produced by the original Python flow. Use these to diff TS outputs for regression checks.
- `DevOops_conf.json` and `HighLoadChannel.json` are the Python-combined exports for the same channels.

Keep this set small/deterministic; add more only if you need broader coverage. Avoid regenerating fixtures unless you also refresh TS goldens.***
